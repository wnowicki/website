### PHP Foundation

- Top level library with all base stuff that other projects are build on
- Base simple contracts (ex. `Entity`, `Arrayable`, `Persistable`, `Repository`) allowing the ability to define some top level characteristics of a class

- Top level *Exceptions* set
- *Automated Adviser* stack including *rules* and *condition* objects. *Conditions* are defined as *bitwise* values so can be combined together. Automated *Advice* processor implementation and *advice* and *risk* objects
