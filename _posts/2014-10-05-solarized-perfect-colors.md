Do you like your editor colors? Or colors of your terminal? Can you work long hours with them?

How important is the code coloring for you? Or how annoying are different color schemes in code editors?

Some time ago I found a nice solution, I found [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover.  It’s a nice set, or even two sets (light and dark) of perfectly combined colors. For more detailed description just check project page. From me I can tell that I’m using light scheme in TextWrangler (see post before) and dark scheme in my terminal and IDE.
