Having to maintain a server-side contact form on a static Jekyll-based website doesn't make much sense. So I've changed or actually simplified it to just display my official contact email address: contact[at]wojciechnowicki.com

BTW Website is now officially ten years old, as it was first published in 2013. Or looking at this [post](/2013/04/15/hello-world-2) it soon will be eleven.
