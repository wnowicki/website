I remember my first days with Mac, when I’ve moved from Ubuntu. There was few missing tools for me, just started to asking friends about and googling in the internet. Now I know how important are good tool on your machine. That’s why I want to share them with you. I’ll focus on (mostly) free software for OS X and sometimes some recommendations for Linux (Ubuntu), but there everything is pretty much in place.

If you miss [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) from Linux probably [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) could cover this gap. What to say, simple and powerful editor.
Source code coloring for a lot of languages, indents, text processing, searches using RegEx and much more. And all of this for free. Enjoy.
