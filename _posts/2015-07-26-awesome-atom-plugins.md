I'm using and recommending to use [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) as a text editor. It's advertised as "*A hackable text editor for the 21st Century*". A lot of plugins are provided with it. Let's check the best of them... I mean my favorites.

## Minimap
Minimap is well know feature from [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), it's really useful zoomed out view of file. It helps with really long files... but who want to create 'really long'.

Install: `apm install minimap`  
Plugin link: [atom.io/packages/minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)

## Git Control
Would like to have Git integrated in Atom? Simple add *Git Control* plugin which provides GUI interface for some of git commands. Probably enough for average daily usage.

Install: `apm install git-control`  
Plugin link: [atom.io/packages/git-control](https://atom.io/packages/git-control)

## Git Plus
Alternatively you can use Git commands in Atom with this plugin. To toggle palette press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`h`. Two grate ways of working with Git in Atom choice is yours.

Install: `apm install git-plus`

## EditorConfig
If you found package using [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) or you want to start using it in your project. Of course Atom has plugin which enables this great standardization feature.

Install: `apm install editorconfig`

## Markdown PDF
Atom is my favorite Markdown editor, it comes with build in Markdown preview feature. But what if you want to save it as `.pdf`? Simply install this plugin.

Install: `apm install markdown-pdf`  
Plugin link: [atom.io/packages/markdown-pdf](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-pdf)

## Atom Beautify
Problem with sticking to coding standards? Just beautify your code with this plugin.

Install: `apm install atom-beautify`  
Plugin link: [atom.io/packages/atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

## Zen Mode
Getting distracted while working in Atom? I can't give you solution for your environment but you can resolve any distractions on your machine, just go for Zen. Activate with `Cmd`+`Ctrl`+`z`.

Install: `apm install zen`  
Plugin link: [atom.io/packages/zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen)

## Additional Languages
Need additional languages support? In Atom, no problem! In your *Settings* (`Cmd`+`,`) then *Install* and search for `language-[your_language]`. In my case it was `language-matlab`. Works great.

## What About You?
I'm curious what favorite plugins do you have? What I can still improve in my editor.
