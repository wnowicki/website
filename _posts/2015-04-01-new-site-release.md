I can proudly present you new version of my personal website.

I've switched from Wordpress to... static website. Yes that's right! It's website based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) engine. You can find more information about stuff I've used in [credits](/credits) section.

### Why?

Why to switch from Wordpress if you have already setup and stable running instance of it? So:

- [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) - I'm not using any benefits of heaving this powerful engine. So I don't need all of its features and extensions. This solution is easier for me as I'm not Wordpress ninja, I can achieve here better results.
- [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - Wordpress is more complex solution so more things can break there. So if I'm not using benefits of it why to keep all threats. I'm not an active writer so I can write things in my code editor and release them.
- Flexibility - which I've already mentioned. I can have better control of layout etc. Without diving into Wordpress.
- ... you sometimes need a change!

*Hope you'll enjoy it!*
