Maybe it isn’t the latest news, but this major release could be good reason to back to my blog. It’s a little bit not up to date… only a few posts from April 2013, almost 1,5 year ago as also rest of information is not currently as is should be.

Now more in english! Why? I’m living in the UK now that’s a good reason, but honestly… previously I was thinking ‘blog in polish for polish readers’ but english is so common in IT.

Maybe a little bit about WordPress 4.0, as for the first view on it I don’t see huge changes, admin panel was transiting for a while and now it’s much better than it was but it isn’t one step change. Maybe I’ll find more differences and features in future.

PS Next thing on a blog list is Twitter integration. Even I should put link to my Twitter account which is https://twitter.com/wonowicki
